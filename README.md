This is a 2D puzzle game made with raylib/C++. The plan is contributing to this project until we have a polish game demo.

# How to Run
The application should be able to run on Windows without build.

Just clone the repo with the command
```
git clone --recurse-submodules <URL>
```
and run the command
```
hotrun.bat
```

# Build from source 
If you want to build the project, make sure you have MSVC 2019 or 2022 installed in your system (I've only tested these two versions), then in the project directory, simply run
```
build
```
If you want a clean build run
```
build clean
```
